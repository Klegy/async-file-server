# Async File Server
Light-weight, cross-platform (NET Core 2.0) C# Asynchronous file server and text messaging platform. Utilizes custom extension methods which wrap asynchronous TCP socket method pairs (BeginProcess/EndProcess) within a single method which returns a Task object, providing the benefits of the Task Parallel Library (TPL) to socket programming.
